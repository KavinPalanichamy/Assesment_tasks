Propose an algorithm which defines a process of designing and improving a light and durable chair with a backrest.
The structure of the chair should be made of a set of straight bars. 
Deliver the algorithm in a form of flowchart (e.g. created using draw.io).

Conduct a thought experiment to demonstrate sample results according to your algorithm - walk through the algorithm and 
draw manually the result it generates in successive steps, starting from the initially created geometry, to the finally improved one. 
Deliver you drawings together with the flowchart.

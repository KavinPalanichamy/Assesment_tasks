-> The given problem is solved by using a  logistic regression model.

-> The model operates with maximum efficiency in the salary range of approximately 20000 > SALARY > 150000 as standardization algorithms used are based on 70000 as mean.

->  Due to the time constrains in developing the algorithm, error handling has not been implemented and hence the model will work only for perfect set of data.

-> To acheive a good efficiency the iterationas has been set to 10000 and the step to 0.1, and hence the model may take a few  seconds to train.

-> A distribution map was generated using MATLAB to verify the outcome in an intuitive wave by identifying the clusters. The graph is included in the folder in .png format
